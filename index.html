                 I created this <a class="link" href="https://development-cs-1300.vercel.app/">React Bookstore</a>. To facilitate its development, I conducted a competetive analysis on
                  sites in the e-commerce bookstore market and organized feature analysis.

                    <h3 class="karla-regular comp_anal_text" id="barnes_noble_text">Barnes & Noble is one of the most popular sites in the space and have a well built site.
                      But it does have its fair share of issues. They have great contrast in their color palette, a plethora of filtering options, and leverage their brand well. 
                      But they have very basic sorting oprions, a couple of distracting elements, and the presentation of their book covers is slightlt jarring against the harsh white background.

                    <h3 class="karla-regular comp_anal_text" id="bookshop_text">Bookshop.org has nice background 'cards' for their books which make the cover-art stand out but is not jarring.
                      The overall contrast is really strong and there is a good sense of hierarchy in their design. Their top bar did present some problems. Rather than having a genre drop-down they list one or two genres.
                      This makes it very difficult to find a way to look for a particulart genre if it is not one of the few pre-selected ones in their top bar.
                       Additionally, when that genre sorting functionality is found, only one genre can be filtered at a time.

                    <h3 class="karla-regular comp_anal_text" id="symposium_text">Symposium Books is a smaller retailer but have a really strong site that spoke to me. They embody strong design philosophy and principles in their design through great color choice, hierarchy, and functionality.
                      Of all the sites this one has the best filtering options, but still only allowed for a single filter to be applied to a selction of books.
                       Additionally, they had very useful and thoughtful sorting options.
